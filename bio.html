            <p>
                Greer Garson is my all time favorite actress. I guess it is that striking red-hair and Anglo-Irish descent that draws me to her. Greer combined an everywoman quality with grace, charm and refinement. It is with no wonder she reigned as the queen of MGM for a decade (1939-1949).
            <br>
                Greer was discovered by Louis B Mayer in (1937) while he was visiting London looking for talent. She was signed to a contract with MGM and appeared in her first American film in 1939. She earned a total of seven Academy Award nominations for Best Actress, five of those were consecutive years, 1941, 1942, 1943, 1944, 1945 and holds the record with Bette Davis for consecutive nominations. In 1942, Greer won the Oscar for her role in Mrs. Miniver, becoming the 20th actress to receive the Academy's Best Actress Award. She is one of 11 actresses who won the Best Actress Oscar for a movie that also won the Best Picture Oscar. Greer would go on to be a central figure in the Golden Age of the studios and regularly appear on box-office polls of the top ten stars during the WWII years. Though the regal, dignified stoicism she embodied served her well, while at MGM Greer said that she would liked to have been cast in some comedies.
            <br>
                Well-known for activities on behalf of education and cultural institutions, Greer donated millions to have the Greer Garson Theater built, at the college of Santa Fe. In addition, there is a Greer Garson Theater on the campus of Southern Methodist University in Dallas. Greer also donated many of her papers and personal effects to the Southern Methodist University Jake and Nancy Hamon Library.
            <br>
                Greer left us with a great legacy. I look forward to every September 29th on Turner Classic Movies as they generally do a birthday tribute to her. Catch you there next year, until then.

                "All I know about getting something that you want is that there are three essential things: wanting, trying and getting the opportunity, the breaks. None works alone without the others. Wanting is basic. Trying is up to you. And the breaks - I do know this, they always happen."...Greer Garson
