            <h3>Fun Facts</h3>
        </hgroup>
            <p>
                Her given name, Greer, was a contraction of MacGregor, her mother's maiden name.
                <br><br>
                She was a fan of the film Top Gun (1986).
                <br><br>
                She always carried her own thick red pencil in her bag. Her signature in guest books was as much of a standout as she was.
                <br><br>
                She wore a different perfume for every new picture.
                <br><br>
                She loved a breakfast of orange juice with a raw egg in it.
                <br><br>
                She kept her weight in check by lunching on hot sauerkraut juice.
                <br><br>
                After she shampooed her famous red hair, she rinsed it with a cup of Champagne, brushed it out one hundred strokes and then tied it up in a net for the night.
                <br><br>
                A fire at her home destroyed the original Oscar she had won for best actress in Mrs. Miniver (1942). The Academy of Motion Pictures later sent her a replacement.
                <br><br>
                Greer was presented a plaque as the Queen of New York’s Radio City Music Hall because more of hr films played there (14) than those of any other actress, they also played for the most number of weeks (83) of any actress.

                On July 23, 1942, Greer put her footprints and autograph in the cement forecourt of Graumans Chinese Theatre (now know as TCL Chinese Theatre). Underneath the cement square, a time capsule was placed containing a print of the motion picture, “Mrs. Miniver” (1942),  a copy of the manuscript and of the book.
