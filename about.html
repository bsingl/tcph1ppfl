                My passion has always been making things, which is why I chose manufacturing and production as a career path. It was a natural fit for me. I love the challenge and reward of taking a product through its entire process from concept to customer. 
                <br>
                I feel lucky that I grasp the world of the internet yet have the wherewithal and experience to be able to go to a manual program if the situation calls for it. Having that balance makes me flexible, efficient and confident that I will be able to handle just about any issue that comes across my plate with grace and humility. Pride in a job well done, dedicated, detailed and focused are attitudes that motivate me each and every day.
                <br>
                The NYPL TechConnect program has created a tremendous opportunity at this juncture in my career, helping to open new doors while allowing me, at the same time, to take my existing skill set and enhance it through a project in new areas and new industries. Real time spent at a company with a need you can fulfill is a reward that is hard to put into words, even more so when you get to be part of something that will have significance to someone or something in the future.
